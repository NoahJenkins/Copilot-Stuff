# Copilot Stuff

This repository contains reusable GitHub Copilot artifacts organized by type: prompts, instructions, and skills.

> Inspired by [github/awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) — a fantastic community-driven collection of Copilot prompts, instructions, and tools. If you find this repo useful, you'll love that one too. Highly recommend checking it out (and contributing!).
