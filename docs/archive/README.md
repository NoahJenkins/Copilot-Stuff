# Archive

This folder stores older artifact versions that are kept for historical reference and comparison, but are not in active use.

## Usage

- Treat files here as archived snapshots.
- Do not use archived files as primary install targets.
- Keep actively maintained artifacts in their canonical directories (`agents/`, `prompts/`, `skills/`, `instructions/`).

## Current archived artifacts

- [onboard-copilot.prompt.md](./onboard-copilot.prompt.md)
